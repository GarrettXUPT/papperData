The repository  contains the rotation symmetric Boolean functions with balance and nonlinearity 116 used in the paper.

This is the result of Rotation Symmetric Boolean Function, The relationship between record form and RSTT as below: 
[1, 2, 3, 34, 35] to [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, ... , 0, 1, 1]

The location of 1 in RSTT is represented by location information.

if you need boolean function source code, you can contact me or browse my other github folder.

If you have any questions about the result, Please contact me, my email is great_shiyu@163.com.
